Recently, I got to know about Danny ma 8WeekSQLChallenge from one of my linkedin connection, in which i gave my first try in Danny's Diner SQL Case study-1.

I enjoyed the every bit of this challenge, it was really a wholesome experience for practicing & sharpening SQL skills.

In this Challenge, I utilized,
1. CTEs,
2. Window functions
3. Case Statements
4. JOINS
5. Aggregate Functions
